# Car Dealership Management System

## Description of the Project

The Car Dealership Management System is a Java console application designed to facilitate the management of vehicle inventory and sales/lease transactions for a car dealership. It allows dealership staff to add, remove, and search for vehicles based on various criteria, record sales and lease contracts, and manage customer information.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to record a lease transaction for a vehicle, capturing customer information, lease terms, and vehicle details, to document the lease agreement and manage inventory accordingly.
- As a user, I want to view the details of a sales contract or lease contract, including customer information, vehicle details, and contract terms, to ensure accurate documentation and customer satisfaction.
